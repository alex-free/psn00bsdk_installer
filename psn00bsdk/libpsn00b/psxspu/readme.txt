	Open source implementation of the SPU library written mostly in MIPS
assembly. Currently only supports SPU init, uploading sample data using DMA
transfer and basic sample playback but is currently lacking a bunch of
important functions.

	Very work in progress currently.

Library header(s):

	psxspu.h


Todo list:

	* SPU RAM allocation routines yet to be implemented (heap must only be
	  stored in main RAM and not SPU RAM like in the official SDK).

	* SpuKeyOn() is actually not part of the official library.

	* SPU reverb configuration functions yet to be implemented.
